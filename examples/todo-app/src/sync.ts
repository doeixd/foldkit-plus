/**
 * The local-first contract, derived from the application.
 *
 * Nothing here restates behaviour. `forApplication(App)` reads the Model and
 * Message schemas, the initial Model, and `update` from `surface.ts`, and the
 * fragments below say only *which* fields replicate and *which* Messages change
 * them. Replay is the application's `update` on the shared slice, and it is
 * guarded: a durable Message that returns a Command or touches a local field is
 * refused at `submit` with a `ReplayError`, so a mistake fails on the first
 * edit rather than diverging replicas later.
 *
 * Two features contribute to one document as fragments. `compose` merges their
 * projections and Message sets and refuses a field declared twice with a
 * different codec, a Message declared durable twice, or a fragment from another
 * application.
 *
 * `authorize` is policy on the contract, per durable variant: `message` is
 * exactly that variant, `shared` is the authoritative snapshot, `principal` is
 * what the server's transport established. `journalContract()` carries the
 * compiled rules in the shape `makeJournal` takes, so `journal.ts` applies them
 * by spreading the contract. The client never runs them (a replica has no
 * principal); a refused operation comes back as a rejection and the replica
 * reverts it.
