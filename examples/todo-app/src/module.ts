 * The application as data.

 * `Module.make` collects the contracts every package declared, in order, and
 * `validate` checks what the types cannot: that every contract belongs to this
 * application, that no two own the same Model path, that no Message is durable
 * in two sync contracts, and that no contract names a field or Message the
 * application does not have. `manifest` says who owns each Model field, which
 * is the "one owner per datum" rule made visible.
