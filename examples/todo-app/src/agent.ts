/**
 * The agent contract: what an agent may see, and what an agent may do.
 *
 * Nothing here reimplements behaviour. Every capability is a Message that
 * `update` already handles, the context is the `Overview` Surface the view
 * could render, and WebMCP, MCP, and A2A are adapters over this one value.
 *
 * Three things to notice:
 *
 * - `add_todo` exposes `RequestedTodo`, the *intent*, not `SubmittedTodo`, the
 *   fact. The agent never mints an id or a timestamp; the Command does. Its
 *   `completion` contract says the call is done when the correlated
 *   `SubmittedTodo` is applied, so `dispatch` resolves with the fact.
 * - `rename_list` completes on *state*, not on a Message: it is done when the
 *   list carries the requested title, whether this call, a synced peer, or
 *   another tab put it there. `add_todo` needs its Message, because only the
 *   fact says which new todo is this call's.
 * - `clear_completed` and `rename_list` carry the same `authorize` rule the
 *   sync contract applies on the server. The agent is refused here, early and
 *   typed; the journal would refuse it anyway, late.
 * - The context is a Surface. The same value could be rendered.
