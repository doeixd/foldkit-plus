> A home for Foldkit ecosystem packages, built on Foldkit's
> Model-·-Message-·-`update` architecture and Effect.

Foldkit keeps an application's behavior in one place: a Schema-typed **Model**, a
**Message** union, and an **`update`** function. Everything here extends that one
state machine rather than introducing a second place for application behavior to
live — an observation boundary projected from the same Model, an agent contract,
server-derived remote state as a Submodel, and a durable log that replicates the
same Messages.

## Packages

| Package | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| [`foldkit-surface`](./packages/surface) | The observation boundary: pure Model projections, reference-based field selection, and typed Message subsets. |
| [`foldkit-remote`](./packages/remote) | Normalized server state as a Foldkit Submodel: entities, selections, queries, connections, mutations, and live changes. |
| [`foldkit-remote-server`](./packages/remote-server) | Entity, query, mutation, and live sources, selection authorization, and `RemoteRpc` handler compilation. |
| [`foldkit-remote-drizzle`](./packages/remote-drizzle) | Compiles Remote selections and queries to Drizzle's typed query graph. |
| [`foldkit-agent`](./packages/agent) | The protocol-neutral agent contract: project a Model and Message union into a deliberate agent interface. [Design rationale](./docs/design/agent-DESIGN.md). |
| [`foldkit-agent-webmcp`](./packages/agent-webmcp) | The browser adapter, projecting exposed Messages into `document.modelContext`. |
| [`foldkit-agent-mcp`](./packages/agent-mcp) | The external MCP adapter: a transport-free protocol handler, plus stdio and Streamable HTTP. |
| [`foldkit-agent-a2a`](./packages/agent-a2a) | The A2A adapter: an Agent Card and `message/send` as tasks. |
| [`foldkit-agent-native`](./packages/agent-native) | The Agent Native adapter: compiles exposed capabilities into framework actions whose `run` only dispatches. |
| [`foldkit-durable`](./packages/durable) | A durable, ordered operation log on `effect/unstable/sql`, with migrations, compaction, change streams, a durable effect ledger, and metrics. |
| [`foldkit-sync`](./packages/sync) | A local-first replica: offline outbox, optimistic projection, reconciliation, presence, and a reconnecting WebSocket transport. |
| [`foldkit-mixins`](./packages/mixins) | Typed slot contracts and inside-out Style/Behavior attachments for Foldkit views. |
| [`foldkit-mixins-surface`](./packages/mixins-surface) | Bridges a Surface's projected Model and Message subset to a `SlotView`. |
| [`foldkit-mixins-ui`](./packages/mixins-ui) | `@foldkit/ui` adapters that publish a component's attribute bundles as Slots. |

Every package is on npm; the [release matrix](./docs/releases.md) lists each
one's version.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add foldkit-agent                       # the contract
pnpm add foldkit-agent foldkit-agent-webmcp  # browser (WebMCP)
pnpm add foldkit-agent foldkit-agent-mcp     # external MCP
pnpm add foldkit-agent foldkit-agent-a2a     # A2A
pnpm add foldkit-agent foldkit-agent-native  # Agent Native
pnpm add foldkit-durable foldkit-sync        # offline, multiplayer, remote-agent state
pnpm add foldkit-surface foldkit-remote      # projections; normalized server state
pnpm add foldkit-remote-server foldkit-remote-drizzle  # the server side of Remote
pnpm add foldkit-mirror                      # a Model slice in the URL or a key-value store
pnpm add foldkit-mixins foldkit-mixins-surface foldkit-mixins-ui  # slot contracts for views
```

`foldkit` and `effect` are peer dependencies. Foldkit `0.158.2` peer-depends on
`effect@4.0.0-rc.112`, so these packages target Effect 4. `foldkit-durable`
requires Node 22 for `node:sqlite`.

## How they fit together

The packages fall into one observation boundary and three extensions to the same
state machine:

- **Observation.** `foldkit-surface` projects the Model into a pure `Projection`
  and selects Message subsets. Remote, Sync, and Agent consume this instead of
  declaring their own Model and Message shapes.
- **Server-derived state.** `foldkit-remote` keeps a normalized cache of server
  data as a Foldkit Submodel; the application's `update` reconciles reads,
  mutations, and live changes. `foldkit-remote-server` and
  `foldkit-remote-drizzle` are its server half.
- **Replicated state.** `foldkit-durable` orders and persists *the same Messages*
  on a server, and `foldkit-sync` keeps an offline-first replica on each client,
  so devices converge.
- **Agents.** `foldkit-agent` projects *what an agent may see and do* from the
  Model and Message union; the adapters turn that contract into tools.

                    remote-server     (local replica)
                    remote-drizzle
```

None reimplements `update`: the agent layer projects it, Remote reduces its facts
through the application's `update`, and the replication layer replays the same
Messages through a shared reducer. Separately, `foldkit-mixins` is a view-layer
axis — it composes styles and behaviors over plain Foldkit views, and
`foldkit-mixins-surface` over a Surface projection, without owning a second
runtime.

- Each package README documents its API; [`examples/`](./examples) has runnable
  traces, and `pnpm demo` runs them.

## Releasing

Every package under `packages/*` publishes; the
[release matrix](./docs/releases.md) lists each one's version. `pnpm release`
builds, then publishes every non-`private` package, skipping versions the
registry already has. Publishing must use **pnpm**, not npm: the packages declare
each other as `workspace:` dependencies, which pnpm rewrites to real ranges when
it packs.

Bump the versions, add a [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) entry, run the four
checks, then push a `vX.Y.Z` tag. The
[release workflow](./.github/workflows/release.yml) re-runs the checks. It
publishes with provenance when the `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret is set, and
otherwise runs the checks and skips publishing.
