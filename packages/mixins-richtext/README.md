# foldkit-mixins-richtext

The rich-text editor's chrome, drawn through [Mixins](../mixins) slots.

The editor is a Bundle that renders one host element and nothing else (§29 of the
Rich Text design): the toolbar beside it is the application's chrome. This package
draws that chrome as a `SlotView`, so every element it makes is a slot an
application styles or extends the way it does any other view.

It does not wrap `foldkit-richtext-dom/toolbar`'s `marksToolbar`, and cannot: a
slot's contributions resolve at the element the view creates, so a slot view owns
its elements. The two share `markActive`, the rule that decides whether a mark is
lit.

## Status

Early: the `foldkit-richtext` family is 0.x, and its API may change between minor
versions. The first slice is the mark toolbar; the rest of the design's editor chrome (floating toolbar,
link popover, block handle, placeholder, status) arrives when a view needs it.

## The mark toolbar

```ts
import { Style } from 'foldkit-mixins'
import { MarkToolbarSlots, markToolbar } from 'foldkit-mixins-richtext'

const Toolbar = markToolbar<Message>().pipe(
  Style.attach(Style.forSlots(MarkToolbarSlots)({ button: Style.class('mark-button') })),
)

// In a view: `toggled` builds the caller's own Message from a mark.
Toolbar(
  {
    state: { document, selection, storedMarks },
    toggled: mark => edited(Message.ToggledMark({ mark })),
  },
  h,
)
```

`state` is what the editor projects (`document`, `selection`, `storedMarks`); `marks`
defaults to the three `foldkit-richtext` ships; `toggled` turns a mark into the
caller's Message, which is a function because a caller usually dispatches its own
wrapper. Each button renders with its mark as the slot item's `id`, so a Behavior
can single one out.

| Slot | Capability | Renders |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | Container | the toolbar's wrapper |
| `toolbar` | Collection | the row of buttons |
| `button` | Interactive | one mark's button, per mark |

The view owns each button's click and its pressed state, so neither is in a slot's
contract: a mixin cannot take them over.

## Checks

```bash
pnpm --filter foldkit-mixins-richtext typecheck
pnpm vitest run packages/mixins-richtext/test
```

`smoke/` checks the *built* richtext packages the way a consumer meets them —
through each package's `exports` map, from `dist`. Everything inside this workspace
resolves them from source, so nothing else catches a wrong `exports` path, a
missing file, or a wrong `types` condition. Build first, then:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm --filter foldkit-mixins-richtext smoke
```
