# `foldkit-agent`

Lets an agent use a Foldkit application through the transitions it already
has. It adds two boundaries and nothing else:

```text
Model         -> context projection   what an agent may see
Message union -> Agent.expose         what an agent may do
```

A capability **is** a Message, so an agent cannot do anything the application
cannot, and there is no second implementation of a feature to keep in step. The
context is a `foldkit-surface` projection, so the value a view renders is the
value an agent reads. `update` remains the single source of truth, and the
protocol adapters are translation only.

What you get for declaring that once: typed input decoded at the boundary,
capabilities that appear and disappear with the Model, authorization beside the
Messages it governs, a completion contract so a call resolves on the fact rather
than on receipt, an audit log of every decision, and four protocol adapters that
add no authority of their own.

**Use it when** an assistant, a copilot, or another service should drive the
application the way a person does. **Not for** DOM automation: this dispatches
Messages, so if the behaviour is not a Message, add one. **Not a guarantee of
exactly-once effects**: completion says a correlated fact was applied, not that
an external action can be safely repeated.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add foldkit-agent
```

`foldkit` and `effect` are peer dependencies. The
[agents guide](https://github.com/doeixd/foldkit-plus/blob/main/docs/agents.md) covers the mental model, and
[examples/todo](https://github.com/doeixd/foldkit-plus/tree/main/examples/todo) is a worked contract.

A community package, not affiliated with or endorsed by the Foldkit
maintainers.

## Usage

Start from a normal Foldkit application:

```ts
import { Schema } from 'effect'
import { defineMessageUnion } from 'foldkit/message'

const Todo = Schema.Struct({
  id: Schema.String,
  title: Schema.String,
  completed: Schema.Boolean,
})

const Model = Schema.Struct({
  todos: Schema.Array(Todo),
  selectedTodoId: Schema.Option(Schema.String),
})

type Model = typeof Model.Type

const Message = defineMessageUnion({
  RequestedCreateTodo: { title: Schema.String },
  RequestedRenameTodo: { id: Schema.String, title: Schema.String },
  RequestedDeleteTodo: { id: Schema.String },
  ReceivedTodos: { todos: Schema.Array(Todo) },
  FailedToLoadTodos: { message: Schema.String },
})
```

Bind the constructors to your application, then declare the contract:

```ts
import { Agent } from 'foldkit-agent'
import { Projection, Surface } from 'foldkit-surface'
import { Option, Schema } from 'effect'

const App = Surface.application({
  Model,
  Message,
  initial: { todos: [], selectedTodoId: Option.none() },
  update: (model, message) => ({ model: update(model, message) }), // your update
})

const TodoAgent = Agent.forApplication(App)

const AppAgent = TodoAgent.make({
  // What an agent may see: a Surface projection, so sync and the agent can share
  // the same value. `lastError` is deliberately not selected.
  context: Projection.pick(App.fields.todos, App.fields.selectedTodoId),

  messages: TodoAgent.expose(Message, {
    // A variant that needs nothing but a description can be written as one.
    RequestedCreateTodo: 'Create a new todo',
    RequestedRenameTodo: 'Rename an existing todo',
    RequestedDeleteTodo: {
      name: 'delete_todo',
      description: 'Delete the selected todo',
      available: model => Option.isSome(model.selectedTodoId),
    },
  }),
})
```

`ReceivedTodos` and `FailedToLoadTodos` are never reachable by an agent.
Exposure is opt-in, and there is deliberately no `exposeAll()`.

Bind the contract to a live Runtime:

```ts
const agentRuntime = TodoAgent.bind({
  definition: AppAgent,
  host: {
    model: currentModel,
    dispatch: sendToRuntime,
    subscribe: onModelChange,
  },
})
```

The host must accept every Message the contract can construct -- a wider union
is fine, a narrower one is a type error -- and a contract whose hooks read a
principal must be given a `principal` provider of the matching type.

## API

| Function | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Surface.application({ Model, Message, initial, update })` | Captures the application once; `App.fields` are typed field references. `initial`/`update` are optional (a runnable application is needed only for sync). |
| `Projection.pick(App.fields.todos, ...)` | The information boundary: what an agent may see. |
| `Projection.compose(...)` | Compose disjoint picks into one context. |
| `MessageSet.make(App, [constructors])` / `MessageSet.union(...)` | A typed Message subset, and the union of several disjoint subsets. |
| `Agent.expose(Message, variants)` | The capability boundary: what an agent may do. |
| `Agent.exposeSubset(subset, variants)` | The same, restricted to a `MessageSet.make` subset. |
| `Agent.variant(config)` | A mapped variant whose callbacks are inferred from its `input`. |
| `Agent.resource(name, options)` | A named read-only projection of Model state. |
| `Agent.make({ context, messages, resources })` | The protocol-neutral contract; `context` is a `Projection`, a `Projection.pick`, or a feature Surface. |
| `Agent.forApplication(App)` / `Agent.forApplication(App).withPrincipal<Principal>()` | The above, with `Model` inferred from a `Surface.application`; `withPrincipal` fixes the `Principal` type. |
| `Agent.forModel<Model>()` | The same, when only a Model (no application) is available. |
| `Agent.bind({ definition, host })` | Binds the contract to a live Runtime. |
| `Agent.schema/messages/resources/contextSchema` | Introspection, as plain data. |
| `Agent.toManifest(definition)` | The contract as `agent.json`, for committing and diffing. |
| `Agent.toMarkdown(definition)` | The contract as documentation. |
| `Agent.auditLog(options)` | A bounded record of decisions, refusals included. |
| `Agent.summarize(result)` | One outcome summary, so the adapters map results to their protocols the same way. |
| `Agent.newInvocationId()` | The default invocation id generator, for an adapter supplying its own. |

### Variant configuration

```ts
RequestedDeleteTodo: {
  name: 'delete_todo',              // optional; defaults to requested_delete_todo
  description: 'Delete a todo',     // required
  available: model => ...,          // optional: does the capability exist in this Model?
  authorize: ({ principal, input, model, transport }) => ...,  // optional
  input: Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.String }),                 // optional external input
  toMessage: ({ id }, { invocation }) => ({ id, source: 'Agent' }),
}
```

`input` and `toMessage` must be supplied together; supplying `input` alone is a
type error and a runtime error.

Written inline, `toMessage` and `authorize` are both checked against the
variant's own input -- the payload for a direct variant, the `input` codec's
decoded type for a mapped one -- alongside `principal`, `model` and `transport`.
No annotation is needed.

The one thing `expose` cannot infer inline is `completion`. `success` and
`failure` are inference sites, so written inline `correlate` receives any
Message of the union; `Agent.variant` narrows it to the Messages the contract
actually names:

```ts
RequestedDeleteTodo: Agent.variant({
  description: 'Delete a todo',
  input: Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.String }),
  toMessage: ({ id }, { invocation }) => ({ id, requestId: invocation.id }),
  completion: {
    success: Message.DeletedTodo,
    // `result` is DeletedTodo here, not any Message.
    correlate: (request, result) => request.id === result.id,
  },
}),
```

Reach for it when a completion contract's `correlate` should be checked against
the Messages it names. Otherwise write the variant inline.

Without an explicit `name`, the tag is normalized: `RequestedDeleteTodo` becomes
`requested_delete_todo`. Every capital starts a word, with no special case for
runs of them, so a tag with an acronym is better given an explicit name.

A capability `name` becomes a protocol-facing tool name, so it must match
`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}`. An invalid name fails at `Agent.expose`, rather than at
registration where the client would reject it with no reference back to the
contract.

### Introspection

The contract is data, so it is testable without an LLM:

```ts
expect(Agent.messages(AppAgent).map(message => message.name)).toEqual([
  'create_todo',
  'rename_todo',
  'delete_todo',
])
```

### Documenting a contract

The contract is data, so its documentation is generated rather than written:

```ts
writeFileSync('agent.json', JSON.stringify(Agent.toManifest(AppAgent), null, 2))
writeFileSync('AGENT.md', Agent.toMarkdown(AppAgent))
```

Both are reproducible for a given contract and read nothing from the Model, so a
committed manifest makes a change to what an application exposes show up in
review rather than only at runtime.

### Dispatch

Every invocation runs the same five steps, in this order:

1. **Resolve** the capability, by Message constructor or by protocol name.
2. **`available(model)`** — does this capability exist in the current Model?
3. **Decode** the input through the capability's own Effect Schema.
4. **`authorize`** — may this principal do it?
5. **Construct and dispatch** the Message into the host.

A refusal at any step before the last sends no Message at all. `available` runs
before `authorize` deliberately: a capability the Model does not offer reports
as unavailable rather than leaking whether the caller would have been permitted.
All of steps 2 to 4 read one Model snapshot, taken when dispatch begins.

A capability can be named by its Message constructor or by its protocol name.
Both are checked, and both infer the input:

```ts
agentRuntime.messages.dispatch(Message.RequestedDeleteTodo, { id: 'todo-1' })
agentRuntime.messages.dispatch('delete_todo', { id: 'todo-1' })

// Errors, at compile time:
agentRuntime.messages.dispatch(Message.RequestedDeleteTodo, { todoId: 'x' }) // wrong payload
agentRuntime.messages.dispatch(Message.ReceivedTodos, { todos: [] })        // not exposed
agentRuntime.messages.dispatch('delete_todoo', { id: 'todo-1' })            // no such capability
```

The reference form is worth preferring: it survives a rename of the capability,
and it needs no name at all for a variant that never declared one.

`invocation` is optional. In-app callers can omit it -- the id is generated and
the transport defaults to `in-app` -- while an adapter passes its own:

```ts
agentRuntime.messages.dispatch(Message.RequestedDeleteTodo, { id: 'todo-1' }, {
  id: crypto.randomUUID(),
  transport: 'webmcp',
  signal,
})
```

An adapter reads a tool name and an unvalidated payload off the wire, so
neither can be checked at compile time. That path is `dispatchUnknown`:

```ts
agentRuntime.messages.dispatchUnknown(nameFromTheWire, payloadFromTheWire, invocation)
```

Input is typed as the **encoded** side of the capability's schema, because that
is what dispatch decodes. A payload of `Schema.NumberFromString` is sent as a
string and reaches `update` as a number.

### Audit

Every decision the contract makes can be recorded, refusals included:

```ts
const audit = Agent.auditLog({
  capacity: 500,
  principal: caller => caller.id, // an id, not the whole identity
})

const agentRuntime = TodoAgent.bind({ definition: AppAgent, host, audit })

audit.entries()
// [{ at, invocation, transport, capability, tag, principal,
//    decision: 'refused', outcome: 'AgentAuthorizationError' }]
```

What it will not keep:

- **The input, unless you ask.** It is caller-supplied and may carry anything.
  `includeInput: true` turns it on, and `redact: ['token']` replaces named
  fields.
- **The principal, without a projection.** No projection, no principal --
  identities carry secrets.
- **The Model.** Never, by any setting.

The log is a bounded ring buffer, and a sink that throws never fails a dispatch:
accountability must not become a new way for a capability to break. Pass any
`AuditSink` to forward entries somewhere durable instead.

This is not Model replay. Re-dispatching a recorded invocation stays an explicit
human action.

### Completion

Dispatching a Message and completing an operation are not always the same event.
A capability can say which Messages finish its work:

```ts
RequestedDeleteTodo: {
  description: 'Delete a todo',
  completion: {
    success: Message.DeletedTodo,
    failure: Message.FailedDeleteTodo,
    correlate: (request, result) => request.id === result.id,
    timeout: Duration.seconds(10),
  },
}
```

`dispatch` then waits, and the result carries
`completion: { status: 'completed' | 'failed', message }`. Without a contract,
validated dispatch remains the boundary and the field is absent.

This needs a host that can see Messages, not only receive them:

```ts
host: {
  model: currentModel,
  dispatch: sendToRuntime,
  observe: onMessage, // required by a contract that declares completion
}
```

A contract declaring completion is refused at `bind` when the host cannot
observe, rather than silently reporting every call as complete.

Waiting always has a deadline; it defaults to 30 seconds.
`AgentCompletionTimeoutError` means the wait ended, **not** that anything was
undone -- the Message reached `update`. The same is true of cancelling while a
completion is pending.

Give `correlate` whenever two invocations of a capability can be in flight at
once. Without it the first matching Message wins, whichever invocation caused it.

#### Completing on state

A Message names one implementation path. When what matters is the outcome --
the project now has the requested name, whether a Command result, a live update,
a Sync exchange, or another device put it there -- complete on state instead:

```ts
RequestedRenameProject: {
  description: 'Rename a project',
  completion: Agent.when({
    projection: ProjectName,
    predicate: (name, request) => name === request.name,
  }),
}
```

`predicate` reads the projection's value and the capability's input, both
inferred. The host needs `subscribe`, and `bind` refuses one without it.

Completion is level-triggered: dispatch subscribes first and checks once more
when it starts waiting, so a change made synchronously by `update`, or a state
that already held, is never missed. The result carries `status: 'completed'`
and no `message`. A predicate that throws fails that invocation as a defect and
never the code that changed the Model. `timeout` and cancellation behave as they
do for a Message contract.

An invocation whose signal is already aborted is refused before the Model is
read, and one aborted while decoding or `authorize` is pending never constructs
or dispatches its Message. Both fail with `AgentCancelledError`.

A host failure may occur after delivery, and completion timeouts and
cancellation after delivery do not undo it: the Message reached `update`.

Checking `available` before `authorize` is one half of a single guarantee: an
unavailable capability is
absent from `messages.available`, and dispatching it by name fails with
`AgentCapabilityUnavailableError`. Availability is stronger than tool
visibility -- knowing the name is not enough. Splitting it into separate
discoverability and invocability predicates was considered and rejected:
whichever predicate gates dispatch still has to run before `authorize`, so a
split reintroduces the ordering hazard this order exists to prevent. A
genuinely "hidden but invocable" capability would be a second predicate layered
on `available`, not a replacement for it, and nothing here needs one yet.

Decoding rejects undeclared fields, matching the `additionalProperties: false`
the derived JSON Schema advertises. A capability
with no payload accepts `{}` and nothing else -- not `[]`, not a string, and not
an object with fields it never declared.

Failures are tagged and `Schema`-backed, so `Effect.catchTag` narrows them and
an adapter can encode one to JSON and send it across a protocol boundary:

```ts
dispatch.pipe(
  Effect.catchTag('AgentCapabilityUnavailableError', error =>
    Effect.succeed(`${error.capability} is not available`),
  ),
)
```

`AgentUnknownCapabilityError`, `AgentCapabilityUnavailableError`,
`AgentInvalidInputError`, `AgentAuthorizationError`, `AgentCancelledError`, and
`AgentResourceError`
for resource reads. Every `message` is written for the calling agent: it names
the capability and never restates the underlying decode failure, which stays on
the error's `cause` for the application.

Dispatch runs inside an `Agent.dispatch` span annotated with the capability,
transport, and invocation id, so agent-originated transitions show up in
tracing alongside the rest of the application.

### The Model snapshot

An invocation captures one Model snapshot when dispatch begins. `available`,
`authorize`, and `toMessage` all observe that snapshot, and a later Model change
does not retarget an invocation already in flight.

`host.model()` is called once per invocation, not once per predicate, and
`InvocationContext.model` is that snapshot -- the same value `available` was
checked against. There is no separate field for it.

The host must treat returned Models as immutable and replace them on updates.
The runtime retains the reference; it does not clone the Model. Unknown
capabilities and already-cancelled invocations never read the Model.

This matters because a contextual capability can read the Model twice:

```ts
RequestedDeleteTodo: {
  name: 'delete_selected_todo',
  description: 'Delete the currently selected todo',
  available: model => Option.isSome(model.selectedTodoId),
  input: Schema.Struct({}),
  toMessage: (_, { model }) => ({ id: Option.getOrThrow(model.selectedTodoId) }),
}
```

That is [examples/todo](https://github.com/doeixd/foldkit-plus/tree/main/examples/todo) as written.

The `getOrThrow` is safe only because the Model `toMessage` reads is the one
`available` approved. Re-reading after an async `authorize` would let the two
disagree: `available` passing against a new Model while `toMessage` built from
the old one, or the reverse, so a capability could be dispatched with the
selection it was never offered for -- or throw on a selection that had just been
cleared.

Snapshot consistency is not live-state freshness. One invocation sees one Model;
a later invocation sees the newer one. The Runtime guarantees the first, not the
second. If the user changes the selection while an invocation is suspended, that
invocation still targets the selection captured when dispatch began.

Nothing rejects a dispatch because the live Model has advanced since capture.
Optimistic concurrency -- a version on the snapshot, and an adapter opting into
failing the stale invocation -- is deliberately not provided, on the same footing
as the second availability predicate above: it can be added when a real case
needs it, and adding it early would fix semantics nothing has asked for.

## Why the API looks like this

**Why `bind` and a host, rather than a runtime option.** Foldkit `0.158.2`
accepts no `agent` option on `makeApplication`, and its runtime handle exposes
neither the current Model nor a dispatch function, so an agent seam cannot be
installed from outside Foldkit. `Agent.bind({ definition, host })` is that seam,
with the application supplying `model` and `dispatch`. `Sync.mount` returns a
host of the right shape; [examples/todo](https://github.com/doeixd/foldkit-plus/tree/main/examples/todo) writes one
by hand. If Foldkit later grows the option, it can construct the same seam.

**Why `forApplication` and `forModel`, rather than plain `make`.** TypeScript
cannot infer `Model` from an `available` callback alone, so `available: model =>
…` would leave `model` as `any`. `Agent.forApplication(App)` infers it from a
`Surface.application`, with `App.fields` typed; `Agent.forModel<Model>()` fixes
it when there is no application. `Agent.make` is still there when the Model does
not matter.

**Effect 4, not 3.** Foldkit `0.158.2` peer-depends on `effect@4.0.0-rc.112`, so
snippets written against Effect 3 need translating: `Schema.OptionFromSelf` is
`Schema.Option` here.

The [design rationale](https://github.com/doeixd/foldkit-plus/blob/main/docs/design/agent-DESIGN.md) records the
alternatives that were considered and rejected.
