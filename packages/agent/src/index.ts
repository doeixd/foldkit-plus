/**
 * `foldkit-agent` — a thin, Schema-first agent layer for Foldkit.

 * Project a Foldkit application's Model and Message union into a deliberate,
 * protocol-neutral agent contract:
 *
 * ```text
 * Model         -> a Surface projection  (what an agent may see)
 * Message union -> Agent.expose          (what an agent may do)
 * ```
 *
 * Everything else — WebMCP, MCP, in-app agents, A2A — is an adapter over the
 * resulting `Agent.Definition`. `update` remains the single source of truth.
