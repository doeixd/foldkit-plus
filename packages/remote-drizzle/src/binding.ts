/**
 * Binding a Remote entity to a Drizzle table.
 *
 * Adapted from fate's Drizzle integration (MIT, Copyright (c) 2025 Nakazawa
 * Tech); see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
 *
 * A binding **is** a `foldkit-remote` `EntityDescriptor`: `entity(name, table)`
 * derives the Entity's fields from the table, each declared relation adds a ref
 * field (keeping the foreign-key column too), and each computed adds a number.
 * So one declaration serves `Selection.make` and `source`/`query`, and relation
 * and computed fields are typed.
