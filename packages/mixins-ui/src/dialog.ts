 * Dialog is a Submodel: each published bundle is a `ChildAttribute` group that
 * carries the dialog boundary's dispatcher. The resolver treats those as opaque
 * and preserves their identity, so spreading a resolved bundle into the parent's
 * markup keeps routing through the dialog's `toParentMessage`.
 *
 * `dialog` owns `cancel` (the native Escape handler); `backdrop` and
 * `closeButton` own `click`. A Behavior adding its own handler to one of those
 * is a conflict, not a second silent owner.
