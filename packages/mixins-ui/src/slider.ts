/**
 * Slider is a Submodel: each published bundle is a `ChildAttribute` group that
 * carries the boundary's dispatcher. The resolver treats those as opaque and
 * preserves their identity, so spreading a resolved bundle into the parent's
 * markup keeps routing through the slider's `toParentMessage`.
 *
 * The base installs the pointer handler on `track` and `thumb` only while the
 * slider is interactive. A Behavior adding one of those owns it in the same
 * window, so a second owner is a conflict rather than a silent takeover. Its
 * keyboard handler is `OnKeyDownPreventDefault`, a distinct tag from `KeyDown`,
 * so the thumb does not advertise `Event.KeyDown` (it would falsely imply a
 * conflict the resolver cannot see).
