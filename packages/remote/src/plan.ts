/**
 * The pure requirement planner.
 *
 * A `Requirement` is plain data: which entity fields a Remote projection needs,
 * and through `relations`, which fields of each relation's target. `plan` diffs
 * requirements against the store and returns only the missing fields, grouped
 * and deterministically ordered. A relation whose field is being fetched keeps
 * its nested requirement on the request, so the server resolves the graph in
 * one read; a relation whose refs the store already holds is followed into
 * concrete requirements for the targets. Time enters through `PlanFreshness`,
 * never from ambient state; `force` plans every field.
