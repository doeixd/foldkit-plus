# `foldkit-remote-server`

The server half of [`foldkit-remote`](https://github.com/doeixd/foldkit-plus/tree/main/packages/remote).
It owns the semantic work Effect RPC does not know about: entity, query, and
mutation Sources, **selection authorization**, normalization, and compilation to
the `RemoteRpc` handlers.

It does not own HTTP, WebSockets, serialization, the authentication protocol, or
database connections. `principal` is resolved outside and passed in; runtime
dependencies stay in the Effect environment instead of being captured.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add foldkit-remote-server
```

`effect` is a peer dependency; `foldkit-remote` and `foldkit-surface` come with
it. `foldkit-remote-drizzle` compiles its selections and queries to SQL.

## Quick start

```ts
import { Effect, Schema } from 'effect'
import { Entity, Mutation, Query, RemoteRpc } from 'foldkit-remote'
import { RemoteServer } from 'foldkit-remote-server'

const Project = Entity.make(
  'Project',
  Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.String, name: Schema.String, privateNotes: Schema.String }),
)

const RenameProject = Mutation.make('RenameProject', {
  Input: Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.String, name: Schema.String }),
  Output: Schema.Struct({ id: Schema.String }),
})

const ProjectsByOwner = Query.make('ProjectsByOwner', {
  Input: Schema.Struct({ ownerId: Schema.String }),
  Result: Query.connection(Project),
})

const Server = RemoteServer.make({
  entities: [
    RemoteServer.entity(Project, {
      authorize: (principal, fields) => fields.filter(field => principal.canRead(Project, field)),
      read: ({ ids, fields, windows, principal }) => loadProjects({ ids, fields, windows, principal }),
    }),
  ],
  mutations: [
    RemoteServer.mutation(RenameProject, ({ input, principal }) =>
      renameProject(input, principal).pipe(
        Effect.map(output => ({
          output,
          entities: [Entity.patch(Project.ref(input.id), { name: input.name })],
        })),
      ),
    ),
  ],
  queries: [
    RemoteServer.query(ProjectsByOwner, ({ input, window, principal }) =>
      projectsPage({ ownerId: input.ownerId, window, principal }),
    ),
  ],
  live: [
    RemoteServer.live(Project, {
      subscribe: ({ requirements, after, principal }) =>
        projectEvents({ ids: requirements.map(request => request.id), after, principal }),
    }),
  ],
})

const handlers = RemoteServer.handlers(Server, principal)
const layer = RemoteRpc.toLayer(handlers)
// FoldkitRemoteRead, FoldkitRemoteMutate, FoldkitRemoteQuery, FoldkitRemoteLive
```

`handlers(server, principal, options?)` takes a `HandlerOptions<P, R>`:
`maxIdsPerEntity` (default 1000) bounds a read batch and a live subscription
per entity, `maxDepth` (default 8) bounds nested resolution, and `live` is the
hub whose signals reach the subscriptions this handler registers. In-process,
the handlers are a `RemoteClient` through `Remote.clientLayer(handlers)`, with
whatever the sources require supplied by `Layer.provide`.

## Sources

### `RemoteServer.entity`

```ts
RemoteServer.entity(Project, {
  authorize?: (principal: P, fields: readonly string[]) => readonly string[],
  read: (context: { ids; fields; windows?; principal }) =>
    Effect.Effect<ReadonlyArray<{ id: string; values: Record<string, unknown> }>, RemoteServerError, R>,
})
```

Given the Entity, a request for a field it does not declare never reaches
`read` or `authorize`; `RemoteServer.entity({ name: 'Project' }, …)` declares
no fields and passes every requested one through.

`read` is called once per entity, id batch, and window per read level: ids are
batched up to `maxIdsPerEntity`, ids that page a relation differently are read
separately, and a nested selection reads its next level after the refs arrive.
`windows` carries the pagination window for each requested relation field. The result may be a partial
entity: a field the source omits is simply not present, and presence metadata on
the client reflects that.

### `RemoteServer.query`

```ts
RemoteServer.query(ProjectsByOwner, ({ input, window, principal }) =>
  Effect.Effect<QueryPage, RemoteServerError, R>,
)
```

`QueryPage` is `{ edges, start, end }`; `start`/`end` are `Boundary` values
(`Terminal`, `Cursor`, or `Unknown`) so the client can merge the page without
inferring adjacency from row count.

### `RemoteServer.mutation`

```ts
RemoteServer.mutation(RenameProject, ({ input, principal }) =>
  Effect.Effect<
    { output: Output; entities?: NormalizedPatch[]; connections?: ConnectionChange[] },
    RemoteServerError,
    R
  >,
)
```

`input` is decoded against the mutation's `Input` schema first, so the callback
receives the typed input. `output` is encoded against `Output`; `entities` are
the normalized cache patches the client will reconcile, and `connections` the
confirmed connection inserts and removes that replace the client's optimistic
ones in place: `RemoteServer.prepend(connection, ref)`, `append`, and
`remove`, where `connection` is a `QueryRef` or its identity.

### `RemoteServer.live`

```ts
RemoteServer.live(Project, {
  subscribe: ({ requirements, after, principal }) =>
    Stream.Stream<LiveChange, RemoteServerError, R>,
})
```

`after` is the client's resume cursor; events at or before it are duplicates. The
handler merges the requested entities' streams and maps a source failure onto the
wire error. An entity with no live source contributes nothing, so the client
plans a refetch instead of failing the stream. A `LiveChange` is an entity patch
or delete, or a connection insert/remove/invalidate.

### `RemoteServer.liveHub`

The higher-level signal. A hub tracks each live subscriber's requirements and
principal, so the server says *what changed* and the hub works out *who cares*:

```ts
const hub = yield* RemoteServer.liveHub(entitySources)
const handlers = RemoteServer.handlers(server, principal, { live: hub })

// Wherever the data changes (a mutation source, a database trigger):
yield* hub.changed(Project.ref(projectId), ['status', 'updatedAt'])
yield* hub.deleted(Project.ref(projectId))
```

`changed` intersects the fields with what each subscriber selects, re-reads
that intersection through the entity's own source under the subscriber's
principal (one read per principal value and window signature; subscribers
selecting none of the fields do no work), and streams an `EntityPatched`
carrying only the fields that subscriber may see. A record the source does not
return for the changed id reaches nobody. `deleted` streams an `EntityDeleted` to the entity's
subscribers. Cursors continue from the cursor each subscriber resumed at, so
the client's duplicate and gap handling is unchanged. A hub and hand-written
`RemoteServer.live` sources number their events independently; use one or the
other for a given subscription. Nested relation targets are not subscribed by
the hub, only the requirements' own entities.

## Authorization

Authentication and authorization are separate. Authentication answers *who is
this* (Effect RPC middleware → `Principal`); `RemoteServer` answers *may this
principal read this semantic field*. Authorization is mandatory, not opt-in:

- A field the Entity does not declare is dropped before `authorize` sees it.
- An entity with no `authorize` exposes the requested fields.
- An entity with `authorize` exposes only the returned fields, and a field the
  principal may not see is dropped.
- **Never read or return a field the client did not request**, even if a
  permissive `authorize` allows more.
- If no field survives authorization, the entity contributes nothing, so the
  existence of an unauthorized entity is not leaked.

## Hardening

- Each read batch and live subscription is bounded per entity
  (`maxIdsPerEntity`, default 1000, counted across the batch's window groups),
  and an oversized one fails rather than loading unbounded rows.
- A selection nested past `MAX_RELATION_DEPTH` (8) or naming more than
  `MAX_FIELDS_PER_REQUEST` (256) fields of one entity is refused at decode.
- Returned field names are filtered with `Object.hasOwn` and accumulated into a
  null-prototype object, so a crafted field name such as `__proto__` or
  `toString` cannot reach the prototype.
- Handler errors are remapped to the wire error types without echoing internals.

## What it owns

- Entity, query, mutation, and live Sources.
- Selection authorization and field filtering.
- Request grouping, id de-duplication, field unions, and window threading.
- Normalization of source results into wire entities.
- Source-name validation: `RemoteServer.validate(domain, server)` checks every
  entity, query, and mutation source against the domain's `registry`, so an
  undeclared name fails at startup rather than returning nothing at call time.
- Compilation to the `RemoteRpc` handlers.

## Limits

- Transport, serialization, and the authentication protocol are Effect RPC's; the
  application provides the server protocol layer.
- The live wire carries a `LiveChange` union: entity patches and deletes, plus
  connection insert/remove/invalidate events.
- Database and other runtime dependencies are the Source's Effect requirements,
  not this package's.
